# Introduction

Code and files related to zooplankton synthesis

The function `Zooplankton Synthesizer function.R` takes zooplankton data from different surveys and integrates the data according to user-specified parameter choices. The shiny app is a GUI (graphical user interface) that allows folks without R experience to run the zooplankton synthesizer function and download the resulting data. The shiny app also allows folks with all experience levels to easily visualize the data.

The `Zoop data downloader.R` function downloads the zooplankton datasets from their respective online sources and converts them to a consistent format.

There is also some old code that Rosie used to merge the EMP zooplankton and 20mm code with FRP data and some code from Wim. We don't know what it does yet.

# Shiny app

The R shiny app can be accessed in [a limited form hosted online](https://iepsynthesis.shinyapps.io/ZoopSynth/).

The full shiny app can be installed by downloading and running [the installer](https://deltacouncil.box.com/s/3zjd9g0u0koamsmqoe2deyjmrcegwooz). This desktop version of the app can only be installed on windows computers and google chrome must be installed. If R is not already installed on your computer, this installer will install R as well. After installation, the app can be opened like any other desktop windows application. It may take a while to start up (especially the first time you open it). The app will open in a google chrome tab. Simply close the tab to exit the app.

# Community or taxon-specific analyses?

The biggest problem with integrating zooplankton datasets is variability in taxonomic resolution. To resolve this, we have developed 2 approaches to consolidating inconsistent data to "least common denominator taxa." Depending on what type of analysis you wish to run, you may wish for different types of synthesized data.

## For community data analyzers

*I want to analyze the community composition at whatever taxonomic level lets me use all these datasets.*

- Consistent taxonomic categories
- No plankters counted more than once
- Sacrifices some taxonomic resolution
- Removes taxa with no relatives in all datasets (eg., Annelida)

## For specific taxa analyzers

*I want all possible data on these specific taxa.*

- Calculates total CPUE for higher taxonomic levels
- Some plankters appear in multiple nested taxa (e.g., Calanoida, Copepoda)
- Perserves taxonomic resolution and creates taxonomic categories that are comparable across all datasets
- Labels taxa that are comparable across all datasets, warns about those that are not. 

# Size classes

We have integrated zooplankton data from 3 net size classes:

1. Macro (500-505 ![mu](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%24%5Cmu%24)m): Amphipods and mysids
2. Meso (150 - 160 ![mu](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%24%5Cmu%24)m): Copepods, cladocera
3. Micro (43 ![mu](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%24%5Cmu%24)m): Copepods, rotifers

Nets accurately sample zooplankton larger than the mesh size. Zooplankton smaller than the mesh size are still captured and often recorded in datasets, but the resulting CPUEs are not accurate. To account for this we: 

1. Resolve taxonomic resolution separately within each net size class.
2. If `Data = 'Taxa'`, we mark "summed groups" with the net size class from which they were derived.
3. All potentially undersampled data are marked with a flag `Undersampled == TRUE`
4. For the plots in the shiny app, all data with `Undersampled == TRUE` can be removed. However, data downloaded from the app do contain undersampled data. 

# Unresolved issues

For many studies, taxonomic resolution has changed over time. This could confound analyses of zooplankton communities and abundances over time.
