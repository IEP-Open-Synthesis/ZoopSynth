Note: currently the joining.R script uses produced zooplankton table outputs that have been saved from the data_cleaning.R script, instead of just sourcing the data_cleaning.R script. This is because the intended recipient was having issues updating their packages to be able to run the zooper package.
The joining.R script can be changed to source from the main data_cleaning.R script by uncommenting out relevant lines.
