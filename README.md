Code and files related to zooplankton synthesis

The function "Zooplankton Synthesizer function.R" takes the data from the different surveys and meshes them together in different ways. The shiny app is a GUI we wrote to allow folks without R experience download the data.

The "Zoop data downloader.R" just downloads the data from the different sources. 

There is also some old code that Rosie used to merge the EMP zooplankton and 20mm code with FRP data. . There is also some code from Wim. I don't know what it does yet.
