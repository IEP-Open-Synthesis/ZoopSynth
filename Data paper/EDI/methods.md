The Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) is a consortium of State and federal agencies that has been conducting cooperative ecological investigations since the 1970s. The IEP runs over twenty long-term monitoring surveys on biological components of the Upper San Francisco Estuary (for more information, see https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Environmental-Services/Interagency-Ecological-Program). Surveys monitor phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, water quality, and many types of fish. Several fish surveys sample zooplankton concurrently, and information on zooplankton species composition and abundance can be coupled with fish diet studies. The IEP long-term surveys that monitor zooplankton are the Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP; also known as the IEP zooplankton study), 20-mm Survey (20mm), Fall Midwater Trawl (FMWT), Summer Townet Survey (TNS), the Yolo Bypass Fisheries Monitoring Survey (not included in this integrated dataset), and the Fish Restoration Program (FRP). An overview of these programs is provided in study_metadata.csv and sampling locations are provided in stations.csv. Zooplankton surveys sample 3 different size classes of zooplankton, by towing nets with different sized mesh (or in one case a pump that pumps water into a microzooplankton net). Typically, the zooplankton targeted by these different sampling instruments are: macro (500-505 &mu;m) for amphipods and mysids, meso (150 - 160 &mu;m) for copepods and cladocerans, and micro (43-50 &mu;m) for copepods and rotifers.

Every IEP survey that collects zooplankton samples with a mesozooplankton net, which targets adult copepods and cladocerans, because these taxa are believed to comprise the majority of zooplankton in juvenile and adult planktivorous fish diets. Some surveys also sample with micro- or macro-zooplankton nets. 

Environmental Monitoring Program

The Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) Zooplankton Study (also known as the IEP Zooplankton Study) began in 1972 in order to assess trends in fish food resources ranging from San Pablo Bay to the east Delta, as well as to detect and assess the impacts of recently introduced zooplankton species on native species. The study is mandated by Water Right Decision 1641 for operation of the State Water Project and Central Valley Project (SWRCB 2000). The EMP study is conducted by California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), California Department of Water Resources (DWR), and the US Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and currently samples 17 fixed stations and 2 floating entrapment zone stations (locations where the bottom salinity is 2 and 6 PPT). There are also 3 additional stations located in Carquinez Strait and San Pablo Bay, which are sampled during periods of high outflow and low salinity. Historically (prior to 1995) the survey sampled at a much larger number of stations.

Zooplankton for EMP are sampled in 3 different size ranges: microzooplankton are sampled using a pump, mesozooplankton are sampled using a modified Clarke-Bumpus net, and macrozooplankton are sampled using a mysid net. All EMP zooplankton are collected monthly at fixed stations year-round in open channels at high slack tide and preserved in 10% formalin dyed with rose bengal. Macrozooplankton and Mesozooplankton are collected using 10-minute oblique tows with a 124 cm long net with 505 µm mesh, and a 73 cm long net with 160 µm mesh, respectively. Prior to 1974, microzooplankton were sampled with a 930 µm mesh net. Microzooplankton are collected with a Teel marine pump while the intake hose is raised through the water column and pumped into a net with 43 µm mesh. Pump samples collected approximately 1.5 - 1.9 L from 1972 – 2007, and 75 L from 2008 - present, measured by a digital flowmeter connected to the hose.

Microzooplankton samples are passed through a 154 µm mesh sieve nested on top of a 43 µm mesh sieve in the lab, and only the smaller size fraction that passes through the larger sieve and is retained on the smaller sieve is counted. Mesozooplankton and microzooplankton are processed by diluting the sample to a standard concentration (200-400 organisms per ml) and counting organisms until a target is reached. From 1972 to 2003 1-ml subsamples were counted until at least 200 total organisms were counted, from 2004 to 2005 organisms were counted until 6% of the dilution volume had been processed, and from 2006 to present organisms were counted until 6% of the dilution volume had been processed but at least 5 and no more than 20 cells were processed. Macrozooplankton are processed using a sorting tray divided into quadrants for subsampling, targeting at least 220 organisms from 1972 to 1984 and at least 400 organisms from 1984 to present. Lengths are recorded for macrozooplankton (but not included in this dataset), and biomass is estimated by length-weight equations for macrozooplankton and by average values for mesozooplankton and microzooplankton (biomass_mesomicro.csv). Recorded environmental variables for all samples include time, depth, surface and bottom conductivity, surface temperature, Secchi depth, and chlorophyll-a.

20mm Survey

The 20-mm survey was initiated in 1995 by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to monitor postlarval-juvenile Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) distribution, abundance, and timing throughout their historical spring range in the Delta. The survey is mandated under the Endangered Species Act Biological Opinion for operation of the State and Central Valley water projects (USFWS 2019). 20-mm refers to the length of the fish targeted by the net. Zooplankton samples are collected concurrently with fish samples to monitor Delta Smelt food supply. Between 41 and 55 stations have been sampled each year since the survey began.

Zooplankton are sampled twice per month between March and July at fixed stations in open channels. Mesozooplankton are sampled using 10-minute stepped-oblique tows with a 73 cm long 160 &mu;m mesh modified Clarke-Bumpus net. The net is attached to the top of the 20-mm net frame and a flowmeter is mounted in the mouth. Samples are preserved in 10% formalin and then processed as in the EMP Zooplankton Study. Lengths are not recorded and biomass is estimated by literature values. Recorded environmental variables include times, tidal stage, depth, surface and bottom conductivity, surface temperature, Secchi depth, and turbidity.

More information on the 20-mm survey and its methods can be found on the 20-mm survey website: https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/20mm-Survey.

Fall Midwater Trawl

The Fall Midwater Trawl (FMWT) was initiated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife in 1967 in order to determine the relative abundance and distribution of age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis), but the data has also been used for other upper estuary pelagic fish species, including Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), American Shad (Alosa sapidissima), Splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus), and Threadfin Shad (Dorosoma petenense). The FMWT is currently mandated by the 2019 Delta Smelt Biological Opinion for the coordinated operation of the Central Valley Project and State Water Project (USFWS 2019). The FMWT samples 122 stations each month from September to December ranging from San Pablo Bay to Stockton, Hood, and The Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel. FMWT samples both macrozooplankton and mesozooplankton at a subset of these stations since 2011, with some pilot studies in earlier years. 

Zooplankton samples are collected along with the fish trawl at fixed stations in open channels using 10-minute oblique tows. Macrozooplankton are sampled using a 124 cm long net with 505 &mu;m mesh, while mesozooplankton is sampled using a 73 cm long modified Clark-Bumpus net with 160 &mu;m mesh. For both zooplankton sizes, samples are preserved in 10% formalin dyed with rose bengal, then processed as in EMP. Lengths are recorded for macrozooplankton but not mesozooplankton, biomass is estimated for both as in EMP. Recorded environmental variables include time, tidal stage, depth, surface and bottom conductivity, surface and bottom temperature, Secchi depth, Microcystis presence, and turbidity.	

More information on FMWT and its methods can be found on the FMWT website: https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Fall-Midwater-Trawl.

Summer Townet Survey

The Summer Townet Survey (STN) was initiated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife in 1959 in order to determine the relative abundance and distribution of upper estuary pelagic species, namely age-0 Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis). As with the FMWT, the STN is currently mandated by the 2019 Delta Smelt Biological Opinion (USFWS 2019) and began in response to the development of the Central Valley Project pumping plants. The Summer Townet Survey collects mesozooplankton samples from 32 historic stations and 8 supplemental stations ranging from San Pablo Bay to Rio Vista, Stockton, Cache Slough, and the Deep Water Ship Channel. Zooplankton monitoring began in 2005 with samples collected every 2 weeks between June and August.

STN samples only mesozooplankton during their fish trawl with a net attached to the townet frame. Zooplankton samples are collected during 1 of the fish tows at each fixed station in open channels using 10-minute oblique tows. Mesozooplankton are sampled using a 73 cm long modified Clark-Bumpus net with 160 &mu;m mesh and preserved in 10% formalin dyed with rose bengal, then processed as in EMP. Biomass is estimated and recorded environmental variables include time, tidal stage, depth, surface and bottom conductivity, surface and bottom temperature, Secchi depth, Microcystis presence, and turbidity.

Fish Restoration Program

The Fish Restoration Program (FRP) is devoted to restoring 8,000 acres of tidal habitat in the Delta and Suisun Marsh to provide Delta Smelt habitat and 800 acres of low salinity habitat to benefit Longfin Smelt. These restoration projects are pursuant to requirements in the 2019 Biological Opinions for state and federal water project operations (USFWS 2019). The FRP Monitoring Team monitors fish and their food resources (including zooplankton) within these restored wetlands in order to better understand the benefits of the restored habitats to native fish species. The FRP Monitoring Team surveys zooplankton in shallow waters, generally near tidal marshes or sites that will soon be converted to tidal marsh. The FRP has worked closely with some other IEP surveys to compare zooplankton communities in shallow water to the open-water channel samples collected by the long-term surveys (Contreras et al. 2018).

Zooplankton are sampled annually to monthly between March and December beginning in 2015. Samples are taken from haphazardly selected locations within fixed sites at restored and existing wetlands and adjacent open-water areas across the Delta and Suisun Marsh. Macrozooplankton are collected with 10 minute horizontal  surface tows using a 0.4 m x 0.4 m mouth net (500 &mu;m mesh size). Mesozooplankton are collected with 5-minute  surface tows using a 14.6 cm diameter net (150 &mu;m mesh size). A flowmeter is attached to the net for both zooplankton size collections. Samples are preserved in 70% ethanol with rose bengal. Mesozooplankton catch values are calculated using a minimum of five 1 ml subsamples with a pipet until 400 organisms are counted, or 20 ml total, depending on which occurs first. Lengths are recorded for macrozooplankton but not mesozooplankton, biomass is estimated by literature values for both. Recorded environmental variables include time, tidal stage, surface conductivity, surface temperature, Secchi depth, turbidity, Microcystis, pH, chlorophyll, and dissolved oxygen.

More information on FRP and its methods can be found on the FRP data publication: https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/86810e72766ad19fccb1b9dd3955bdf8 (CDFW et al. 2019).

Descriptions of common methods

Mesh sizes

Nets/sieves typically sample zooplankton species whose smallest dimension is larger than the mesh size, but may also capture some organisms smaller than the mesh size (which are under-sampled since some of these smaller plankters are washed through the mesh). Furthermore, organisms significantly larger than the net mesh may be able to avoid the net and thereby evade capture.

Since the meso- and micro-zooplankton data overlap in sampled taxa, we investigated sampling biases of these 2 mesh sizes by comparing taxa counted in both. We used EMP data, filtered to include only stations and dates when both meso- and micro-zooplankton samples were collected. For each taxon (or life stage) represented in both datasets, we compared the total summed catch per unit effort (individuals per m&#x00B3; of water sampled, CPUE) from the mesozooplankton net (153 &mu;m mesh, net) and the microzooplankton (43 &mu;m mesh, pump) to assess where each method may be under-sampling. In almost all cases, the 2 methods had drastically different total CPUEs, with the microzooplankton (pump) sample collecting substantially more individuals (19 out of 23 taxa). The mesozooplankton (net) sample was only better at capturing Cirripedia larvae, Cyclopoida adults, and Oithona similis adults. The 2 catches were very similar for Cyclopoida juveniles (mesozooplankton/net captured 80% of the catch of microzooplankton/pump). Using this information, we developed a list of taxa and life stages under sampled by each method (excluding only Cyclopoida juveniles since the catch was so close), included as undersampled.csv. These undersampled plankton are retained in the integrated zooplankton dataset, but can be flagged and removed using undersampled.csv.

It is important to note that, prior to counting in the lab, the EMP microzooplankton (pump) samples are passed through a 154 &mu;m sieve in lab and the larger size fraction is counted separately (under the assumption that those individuals are better sampled by the mesozooplankton/net sample). Thus, some of the under sampling of larger taxa by the microzooplankton (pump) samples may be an artifact of this lab methodology rather than an effect of the net mesh size. Therefore, undersampled.csv may not apply to other zooplankton studies. 

Tow duration and tow type

Stepped-Oblique net tow

The most commonly used sampling technique employed by IEP’s long-term monitoring surveys is the stepped-oblique net tow. In this method, the zooplankton net is attached to a metal sled. This sled may solely be for meso and macro-zooplankton (as used by EMP and FMWT), or may be  attached to a larger, fish sampling net (as used by 20mm and TNS). The sled is deployed off the back or side of a boat using a winch or a-frame with a cable attached to a winch. The cable is spooled out to a standardized length based on the depth of the water. The boat proceeds at slow speeds while a specified amount of cable is slowly drawn in at specified time intervals following a tow schedule. As the cable is drawn in, the sled rises through the water in a stepwise fashion, sampling each strata of the water column.

Horizontal net tow

In a horizontal net tow, the net is held at a constant depth while the boat proceeds forward at slow speeds. FRP uses horizontal tows in which the net is held just below the surface of the water.

Stationary sampling

In some stations, FRP samples by holding the zooplankton net in a constant position and allowing the current to flow through the net for a pre-defined period of time (IEP Tidal Wetlands Monitoring Project Work Team 2017). This works best when sampling from shore or a stable structure, to attach the net to, and is most commonly used on ebb tides to sample water flowing out of a wetland.

Pump

Pumps are used by EMP for sampling smaller zooplankton (rotifers, copepod nauplii, etc.; Hennessy 2019). Pumps are considered advantageous because the filtered volume is easier to measure and net clogging is easier to monitor, so it is helpful when sampling for very small organisms. However, larger organisms can escape the narrow mouth of a pump intake (Harris et al. 2000).

Measurement of environmental variables

Salinity and temperature

Specific conductivity and temperature are measured by all surveys using YSI probes. Surface measurements are taken 10-20 cm below the surface of the water, while EMP, FMWT, TNS, and 20mm also collect conductivity measurements at the bottom of the water column. For this dataset, we have converted conductivity to salinity using the ec2pss function from the wql R package (Jassby et al. 2017), which converts electrical conductivity to salinity using the Practical Salinity Scale 1978 between 2 and 42 (Fofonoff and Millard 1983) and the extension of the Practical Salinity Scale (Hill et al. 1986) for salinities below 2.

Turbidity and Secchi depth

All surveys measure Secchi depth, the depth at which a black and white disk is no longer visible from the surface. Secchi depth is inversely related to turbidity, which is measured by some surveys (20mm, FMWT, TNS, and FRP) using YSI or Hach turbidity meters starting in more recent years. 

Target organisms identified

Depending on the goals of the study, some surveys will enumerate different organisms than others, and identify them to a different level of taxonomic resolution. For example, EMP’s macro zooplankton samples are only processed for mysids and amphipods. Other invertebrates (insects, isopods, etc), are not counted. FRP’s macro zooplankton samples are processed for all macrozooplankton and micronekton, however insects are only identified to the family level, whereas mysids are identified to species. Comparing these 2 data sets requires understanding and accounting for these differences to avoid erroneously believing that EMP’s samples had lower diversity than FRP’s samples.

Subsampling methods in the lab

Due to the patchy distribution of zooplankton in the water column, most surveys collect relatively large samples and process a randomly-selected subsample of the original sample. However, differences in subsample method can impact precision of an estimate (Guelpen et al. 1982). For these surveys, subsampling is generally conducted through 1-ml pipetted aliquots for mesozooplankton, and divider trays for macrozooplankton.

Divider trays

In the divider-tray method, the macrozooplankton sample is uniformly spread across a plastic tray and a 4-quadrant divider is then dropped on top of the tray. Technicians then enumerate only the invertebrates the lower right-hand corner of the tray. For very heavy samples, this procedure may be repeated so that a 1/16th or a 1/64th fraction of the original sample is enumerated (for specifics, see IEP Tidal Wetlands Monitoring Project Work Team 2017; Hennessy 2019). This technique is simple to conduct; however, it relies on the sample being randomly distributed in the tray. Organisms and detritus may also be stuck under the dividers when they are placed in the tray.

Aliquots

Mesozooplankton samples are typically sampled with a micropipette (for specifics, see Fujimura et al. 2017; Hennessy 2019). The sample is first diluted to achieve a zooplankton concentration of between 200 and 400 organisms per milliliter. The sample is then mixed in a beaker and the taxonomist withdraws a 1 ml subsample with a micropipette and places the subsample on a gridded Sedgewick-Rafter glass slide. The organisms are then identified counted under a microscope. Most surveys process between 5 and 20 of these subsamples. 


Counting techniques

The accuracy of an abundance estimate based on a sample is directly related to the number of organisms counted, assuming they are randomly distributed with a Poisson distribution (Harris et al. 2000). Therefore, the size of the original sample and proportion of the sample enumerated will determine accuracy of any derived abundance estimates. If 1 program collects significantly larger volume samples, or enumerates a higher number of individuals in its subsample, comparing abundance estimates between the 2 surveys could be confounded by their differing accuracies.

Target volumes (% of sample)

All of the microzooplankton and mesozooplankton samples collected by the CDFW long-term surveys (STN, FMWT, EMP, and 20mm) currently target processing a subsample of approximately 6% of the volume of each sample, with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 20 1-ml subsamples (Fujimura et al. 2017; Hennessy 2019). If the target organism concentration is reached (200-400 organisms per ml), this results in at least 1,000 organisms and a maximum of 8,000 organisms counted per sample. When samples contain debris or detritus, dilution volume is often increased to enable staff to see all the organisms on a slide clearly, which results in lower total organism counts.  

Target counts (overall or by taxa) 

Other surveys (FRP, EMP and FMWT’s mysid samples), target a minimum number of organisms counted instead of a minimum percentage of the sample. Currently, these surveys target a minimum of 400 organisms (IEP Tidal Wetlands Monitoring Project Work Team 2017; Hennessy 2019), which gives a precision of +/- 10 % (Harris et al. 2000). 

Calculations

Count per unit effort (CPUE)

CPUE calculations are most frequently based on the volume of water sampled by the sampler. Most IEP surveys estimate volume using a flowmeter in the center of the net mouth (model 2030R, General Oceanics, Inc, Miami Florida). Flowmeter counts are used in conjunction with a meter constant and the net mouth area to estimate volume of water sampled by the net. For EMP microzooplankton samples, the volume of the water pumped into the net is measured directly using a GPI inline digital flowmeter (Great Plaines Industries, Inc, Sparta, NJ) near the output end of the hose where water enters the net for filtration. 

Biomass

Meso- and microzooplankton biomass is most frequently calculated based on average weights derived from literature values. These calculations apply a single value for mg C per individual for all individuals of a given life stage (Culver et al. 1985; Kimmerer et al. 2011). There are no existing biomass values for many species, so related species must be used. 

For mysids collected by EMP and FMWT, the first 100 individuals are also measured to the nearest mm. Biomass is than calculated based on length-weight regressions. Length-weight regressions provide a somewhat more accurate estimate of total biomass, however the extent to which a given individual fits the regression will vary based on sex, reproductive state, health, and time of year. 

We have compiled updated biomass conversions from the literature into biomass_mesomicro.csv and biomass_macro.csv. All species and taxonomic groups are not covered, reflecting gaps in the literature, but these conversion values provide a starting point for researchers interested in estimating zooplankton biomass.
